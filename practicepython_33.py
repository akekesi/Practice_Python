# https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2017/01/24/33-birthday-dictionaries.html
# This exercise is Part 1 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4.
# For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and be able to find that information based on their name.
# Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays.
# When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them.
# The interaction should look something like this:
# >>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
# Albert Einstein
# Benjamin Franklin
# Ada Lovelace
# >>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
# Benjamin Franklin
# >>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706.
