# https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2016/09/24/30-pick-word.html
# This exercise is Part 1 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 2 and Part 3.
# In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary.
# Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code.
# This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments.
# Each line in the file contains a single word.
# Hint: use the Python random library for picking a random word.
